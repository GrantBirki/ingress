VM ingress for directing traffic to other docker compose stacks

## About ⭐

This project assumes that you have a freshly deployed VM in the _cloud_. Now that you have a VM with docker + compose, you might want to host several domains for applications and all in different docker compose stacks. This ingress allows you to expose multiple domains on a single virtual machine and then route traffic to each docker compose stack.

- [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) to run the ingress
- [Caddy](./src) to automatically generate SSL certificates for your domain(s)
- [Branch Deploy workflow](./.github/workflows/branch-deploy.yml) to help you ship changes to production (on your VM)

## Getting Started 🚀

First, clone this repo to your virtual machine / vps. Then enter the directory of the repo you just cloned.

Now run the following command:

> Note: Before you run this command, ensure that you have a DNS record pointed to the static IP of your VM. This is required for the SSL certificate to be generated by [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)

```bash
script/deploy -b "main"
```

This will deploy the `main` branch of ingress

## Updating ingress 🔄

Once your project is fully setup, you will likely want to apply updates from the upstream repository of ingress. To do this, either wait for Dependabot to open a PR or open one yourself.

You can comment `.deploy` on the pull request to branch-deploy and test out the update before fully "committing" to the change and merging the branch into `main`
